//! TP=2 serving wire protocol (TP item A): the control plane for the TP=2 OpenAI server.
//!
//! The cluster sync TCP connection (`cluster::run_head_session` / `cluster::run_node`) is RETAINED
//! for the whole serving session instead of being dropped after `Msg::Config`. All serving traffic
//! flows over it as length-prefixed JSON (the same framing as the sync protocol, via
//! `cluster::send_json` / `cluster::recv_json`), one `ServingMsg` at a time:
//!
//! ```text
//!   head → node:  CalibTable, Step { Admit | Cancel }*, Shutdown
//!   node → head:  Ready
//! ```
//!
//! The `Step` message is the per-decode-step rendezvous: the head's `BatchScheduler::run_tp_head`
//! ships one per step (even when it carries no events), the node's `run_tp_mirror` applies it and
//! runs the identical `decode_step`, so both schedulers hold identical state by construction. The
//! RDMA link (`net::TpLink`) is untouched by any of this — it stays the inference data plane.
